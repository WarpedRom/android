Ok, some direction on how to build this ROM. it is only set up for Nexus Devices at the moment
0. Make working directory by creating folder in your home directory called warped

1. Pulling the repo
repo init -u hppts://github.com/WarpedRom/android.git -b master
repo sync

2. Getting the Linaro Compiler used in this build:
Do the following commands from terminal one at a time:

cd ~/warped
cd prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/
wget http://releases.linaro.org/13.01/components/android/toolchain/4.7/android-toolchain-eabi-linaro-4.7-2013.01-1-2013-01-17_01-27-05-linux-x86.tar.bz2
bunzip2 *.tar.bz2
tar -xvf *.tar
cd ~/warped

3. Compiling the rom
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch
choose your nexus device (warped_toro-userdebug, warped_toroplus-userdebug, or warped_maguro-userdebug)
make otapackage -j# (where # is the the number of cores in your computer)
